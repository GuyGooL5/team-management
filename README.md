# Team management App!
This app manages users and teams with permission levels.

### Work in progress...
It is a work in progress, and isn't yet ready. 
You're more than welcome to come by every now and then to see changes.

### Express, MongoDB, JWT, React, Material Design.
This is a fullstack app that lays on Express.js with mongoose and passport.js with jwt.
It's front is React.js with a beautiful Material design system for responsiveness and scalability.

### Want to try?
For size and convenience this repo excludes node_modules, so on first run make sure to install dependencies.
To start the server download the repository, then you'll find 2 parent directories.

##### Starting the server
Navigate to backend. On first time run "npm install" and it will automatically install dependencies.
After everything is ready, execute "npm start" and it will run the server on http://localhost:3300.

##### Starting the client
As before, navigate to client, then run "npm install". When it's done run "npm start".
The server will start on http://localhost:3000

#### Important!!
The client is still in development stages, in future releases it will become a static folder under backend.
Currently it runs on it's own server for development and debugging.

##### Note:
Althought the client and backend servers run on different ports, the client server is proxied to the backend.
That means that the api calls are refered to the backend as if it was the client's server.
